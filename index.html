            Irish is a Gaelic langauge spoken predominantly in Ireland and amongst the Irish disapora. While English is the most widely spoken language in Ireland, Irish is legally recognised as the first official language of the country.

            The language is still spoken as a first language in the <strong>Gaeltachtaí</strong>, the areas in Ireland with a high proportion of daily Irish speakers. However, the area with the largest number of daily speakers is in fact Ireland's capital city of Dublin.

            Let's learn some basic phrases in Irish!
          </p>
        </section>
        <h2>Tá</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            As in most languages, the verb "to be" is one of the most common and important in Irish.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the present tense this is <strong>tá</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="example">Tá mé go maith! - <em>I am well!</em></p>
          <p>
            <strong>Maith</strong> means "good" or "well".
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mé</strong> is the pronoun "I/me". Here is a list of some of the personal pronouns in Irish:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mé - <em>I</em></li>
            <li>Tú - <em>You</em></li>
            <li>Sé - <em>He</em></li>
            <li>Sí - <em>She</em></li>
            <li>Muid - <em>We</em></li>
            <li>Sibh - <em>You (plural)</em></li>
            <li>Siad - <em>They</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Irish doesn't have an equivalent to the English impersonal pronoun "it". When talking about inanimate objects <strong>sé</strong> or <strong>sí</strong> are used depending on the grammatical gender of the noun.
          </p>

            If you'd like help pronouncing any of these words, <a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fuaim/maith">teanglann.ie</a> is an excellent resource with an online dictionary and voice recordings for many words and phrases.
          </p>
        </section>
        <h2>Ag</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            Let's introduce the preposition <strong>ag</strong>, which means "at" but also is used to indicate possession.
          </p>
          <p>
            When combined with <strong>mé</strong>, it becomes the prepositional pronoun <strong>agam</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="example">Tá Gaeilge agam. - <em>I have Irish</em>.</p>
          <p>
            The phrase <strong>tá Gaeilge agam</strong> is used to mean "I speak Irish". The verb for "speak" isn't used to indicate knowledge or competency of a language in the same way it is in English.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now if someone asks you if you have any Irish you can respond:
          </p>
          <p class="example">Tá cúpla focail Gaeilge agam. - <em>I have a couple words of Irish</em></p>
          <p>
